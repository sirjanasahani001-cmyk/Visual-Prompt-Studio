Create a square image of raindrops on a window, with the droplets in sharp focus in the foreground. The background should be blurred and slightly abstract, showing hints of green, blue, and gray tones, similar to an outdoor scene on a rainy day. The water droplets should vary in size and appear naturally scattered across the glass. The overall mood should feel calm and atmospheric, with realistic lighting and soft color transitions.
